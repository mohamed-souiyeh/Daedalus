# Daedalus_JS

-learning canvas through some simple examples
  like creating some cercles and applying physics on them by bouncing off the wall
  giving them a vilocety and an acceleration which simulate gravity to some extend

started experementing to creat the cell expantion animation which resulted in 
  alooot of abominations and dancing verteces but not the good dancing.

***write a documentation of the process u went through to reach the current result in the animation

okay after finishing the basic cell animation i am gonna start documenting now (not because my friend almost unalived me but because i am a very thoughtfull developer), any way now after i finished the basic Cell enlargement and shrinking animation lets move to adding walls to it and intigrate them in the animation
