## üìñ Introduction

I've always been fascinated by the elegance and beauty of algorithms, especially those used to create and solve mazes. Daedalus is my way of bringing those algorithms to life ‚Äì a simple, yet visually captivating way to explore their beauty.

I hope you have as much fun playing with this project as I had creating it! üòä

## ü§ì The Algorithms

Before we dive into the algorithms, let's understand a few key concepts:

### 1. Graphs & Mazes üó∫Ô∏è
* **Graph:** Think of a graph like a connect-the-dots puzzle. Each dot is a "node," and the lines between them are "edges." Nodes can represent anything ‚Äì cities, websites, or even locations in a maze. The edges show the possible paths between nodes.
* **Manhattan Grid:** Daedalus uses a special type of graph called a "Manhattan grid" to represent mazes. It's like a city block where you can only move horizontally or vertically along the streets (the edges).

### 2. Weight, Cost, & Distance ‚öñÔ∏è
Think of a maze as a simple graph:
* **Nodes:** These are the points or intersections in the maze.
* **Edges:** These are the paths (corridors) between the nodes.

* **Weight:** Each edge (path) can have a weight. Imagine it like a difficulty level for that path. 
    * For example:
        * A narrow, twisting path might have a weight of 5.
        * A wide, straight path might have a weight of 1.
* **Cost:** The total weight of all the paths you've taken so far to reach a certain point (node). Think of it like the total energy or effort you've spent.
* **Distance:** How far apart two nodes are, regardless of the path taken. It's the shortest possible straight line, even if you can't walk that way in the maze.

**Why it Matters:**

Different algorithms care about different things:

* **Some algorithms want the shortest distance:** They might ignore weights and just find the path with the fewest turns.
* **Some algorithms want the lowest cost:** They'll consider weights and try to find the easiest, most efficient route, even if it's a bit longer. 

**In Daedalus:** You can play around with weighted and unweighted paths to see how these ideas affect the way your maze is solved!

### 3. Heuristics in Algorithms üß†

**Imagine you're trying to find the quickest route to a friend's house across town.** You could wander around randomly, but that would take forever. Instead, you use a heuristic ‚Äì a rule of thumb ‚Äì to guide you.

**Heuristic:** It's like a shortcut or a best guess to help you make decisions faster. It might not always be perfect, but it's usually helpful.

**In our example, your heuristic might be:** "Always move towards my friend's neighborhood."

This doesn't guarantee the fastest route, but it's a lot better than going in random directions. You might take a slightly longer route, but you'll get there much faster overall.

**In Pathfinding Algorithms:**

Heuristics work similarly, It's like the algorithm's "instinct" for finding its way through the maze. Imagine the algorithm is navigating a maze to find the exit. A common heuristic is the "Manhattan distance" ‚Äì the straight-line distance to the goal.

**The algorithm thinks:** "I don't know the exact path yet, but I'll prioritize exploring paths that seem to be getting closer to the exit based on this straight-line distance."

**Why Heuristics Matter:**

* **They make algorithms faster:** By focusing on promising directions, algorithms avoid exploring useless paths.
* **They don't always guarantee the best solution:** Sometimes, the heuristic might lead the algorithm astray, but in most cases, it significantly speeds things up.

**now with that out of the way let's check the algorithms used in Daedalus.**

### ü§ñ Maze Generation Algorithms
* **Simplified Prim:** This algorithm is a modified version of the original Prim graph MST (minimum spanning tree) algorithm.
    - It randomly selects a cell from a set of cells that are intended to be visited, adds a random unvisited neighbour of that cell to the set, and links it to the current cell. This process is repeated until all grid cells are visited.

* **Recursive Backtracker:** This algorithm is a tweaked implementation of the graphs algorithm DFS (depth-first search).
    - It explores the grid as deep as it can in random directions before backtracking to the last place where it can continue exploring until the grid is fully explored.

* **Recursive Divider:** This algorithm creates mazes by placing walls on an empty grid, 
    It differs from conventional methods of carving out the maze features.
    - It divides the available space into two at a random point and repeats this process recursively until further divisions are not possible.

* **Randomized Kruskal:** This algorithm is a modified version of the original Kruskal graph MST (minimum spanning tree) algorithm.
    - It utilizes sets to maintain the connected parts of the maze and deconstructs walls between every pair of unlinked sets until all sets are connected.


### üïµÔ∏è Path-Finding Algorithms
* **Dijkstra:** This algorithm ensures the shortest path and supports weighted graphs.
    - It works by expanding outward from the starting node,
    visiting nodes closer to the start first while taking into account the additional cost imposed by the weighted cells.
    - It uses the Priority Queue Data Structure.
* **A\* (A-star):** This graph search algorithm ensures the shortest path and supports weighted graphs.
    - It combines aspects of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristics to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
    - It prioritizes the nodes that are estimated to be closer to the goal based on a heuristic  function (Manhattan distance). \
    By intelligently guiding the search towards the goal, It can often find the optimal path more quickly than Dijkstra's algorithm, especially in large graphs.
    - It uses the Priority Queue Data Structure.
* **Breadth first search (BFS):** This algorithm ensures the shortest path but does not support weighted graphs.
    - It searches by expanding outward from the starting node,
    visiting nodes closer to the start first.
    - It uses the Queue Data Structure (first in, first out).
